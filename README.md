# Expert Teams – Gameplay Analysis & Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes user behaviour during fantasy team creation and identifies friction points that led to the development of the **Expert Teams** feature. Post-launch, a second dashboard was built to monitor adoption, player replacement behaviour, and feature impact.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- SQL  
- Clickstream & Funnel Analysis  

## Key Insights (Pre-Launch)
- Users struggled to select more than **7–8 players** in smaller matches due to unfamiliarity with fringe players.  
- Frequent **tab switching** indicated a need for external validation.  
- Users joining a match with **<10 minutes left** showed extremely high drop-off due to limited research time.  
- Repeated scrolling in the **Tips section** suggested that users were expecting deeper contextual information.

These insights clearly indicated that users needed **guided team recommendations**, leading to the creation of the *Expert Teams* feature.

## Post-Launch Analytics
A dedicated Tableau dashboard was built to monitor:
- How many players users replaced after selecting an Expert Team  
- Time-of-day patterns for Expert Team picks  
- Adoption differences across match types (large vs small matches)  

## Impact
- Expert Teams scaled rapidly and contributed **20% of annual platform revenue**.  
- Enabled data-informed feature iterations and improved onboarding experience.
